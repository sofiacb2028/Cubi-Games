A simple padel game, but with overcomplicated slapping animations and lovely glitches. Another classic from 2023 CE.

Instructions:
1. Player one moves up and down with W and S, respectively
2. Player two moves up and down with Up arrow and Down arrow, respectively.
3. Accumulate points and don't let the ball touch the wall!
